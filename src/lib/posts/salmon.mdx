# Salmon

Salmon are iconic fish renowned for their remarkable life cycle, which spans both freshwater and saltwater environments. Found in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, these fish undertake one of nature’s most extraordinary migrations to reproduce, showcasing their resilience and adaptability.

## Life Cycle

Salmon begin as eggs laid in gravel nests, or redds, in freshwater streams. After hatching into alevins, they rely on yolk sacs for nourishment for weeks. As fry, they emerge and feed on tiny invertebrates like zooplankton. During smoltification, their physiology changes—gills and kidneys adapt for saltwater, and their bodies turn silvery. They migrate to the ocean, where they grow into adults over 1–7 years, depending on the species. When ready to spawn, Salmon return to their exact natal streams, navigating via an acute sense of smell that detects chemical cues from their birthplace. They overcome rapids, waterfalls, and predators like bears. After spawning, most Pacific Salmon die (semelparous), while some Atlantic Salmon may survive to spawn again (iteroparous).

## Species

Salmon diversity is vast:

- **Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar)**: Found in the Atlantic, from New England to Norway, known for multiple spawning cycles.
- **Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)**: The largest, reaching 100 pounds, found from California to Alaska.
- **Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch)**: Aggressive, with silver sides, common in Pacific coastal rivers.
- **Sockeye Salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka)**: Vibrant red during spawning, key to Alaskan fisheries.
- **Pink Salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha)**: Smallest, with a two-year cycle, abundant in the Pacific.

## Habitat

Salmon thrive in cold, oxygen-rich waters. Freshwater habitats include clear streams with gravel beds, while oceanic phases see them in open waters from 4°C to 18°C. Coastal upwelling zones provide nutrient-rich feeding grounds.

## Diet

Salmon are carnivorous, with diets evolving by stage. Fry consume plankton and insects; oceanic adults eat herring, anchovies, squid, and shrimp. Their high-energy diet supports growth and the grueling spawning migration.

## Ecological Role

As a keystone species, Salmon transfer ocean nutrients to freshwater ecosystems. Their post-spawning carcasses enrich streams, feeding aquatic insects, fish, and terrestrial animals like bears and eagles. This nutrient cycling even boosts forest growth via scavengers dispersing remains.

## Human Interaction

Salmon have shaped human cultures for millennia. Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest built economies and rituals around Salmon runs. Today, Salmon support a $3 billion global industry, from wild-caught fisheries to aquaculture. Dishes like smoked salmon, grilled fillets, and sushi highlight their culinary versatility.

## Conservation

Overfishing, habitat destruction (e.g., dams, logging), and climate change threaten Salmon. Warming rivers disrupt spawning, and ocean acidification affects prey. Conservation includes hatcheries, dam removals, and strict quotas. Programs like the Pacific Salmon Treaty aim to balance U.S. and Canadian fisheries.

## Interesting Facts

- Salmon’s olfactory memory is 1,000 times more sensitive than a dog’s, guiding them across thousands of miles.
- Some leap 12 feet over waterfalls during migration.
- Fossil records trace Salmon to 40 million years ago.
- A single female can lay 2,500–7,000 eggs, but only 1–10% survive to adulthood.
- Their pink flesh comes from astaxanthin, a pigment from their diet.
