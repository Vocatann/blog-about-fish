# Halibut

Halibut, colossal flatfish of northern oceans, are masters of camouflage and deep-sea survival, captivating fishers and biologists with their size and strength.

## Physical Characteristics

Born with eyes on both sides, Halibut undergo metamorphosis, with one eye migrating to the right side (Pacific) or either side (Atlantic). They reach 8 feet and 500 pounds, with mottled skin blending into ocean floors.

## Habitat

Halibut dwell at 50–1,000 feet, favoring cold, nutrient-rich waters near continental shelves in the North Atlantic and Pacific. They prefer sandy or muddy bottoms for ambush hunting.

## Diet

Ambush predators, Halibut eat fish (cod, flounder), squid, crabs, and octopus. Their strong jaws and sharp teeth crush prey, with adults consuming up to 10 pounds daily.

## Biology

Halibut grow slowly, living up to 50 years. Females far outsize males, a trait called sexual dimorphism. They spawn millions of eggs in winter, with larvae drifting in currents.

## Ecological Role

Halibut control populations of mid-level predators, stabilizing deep-sea food webs. They’re prey for seals, sea lions, and orcas, bridging benthic and pelagic ecosystems.

## Human Interaction

Valued for firm, white meat, Halibut support commercial and sport fishing. Indigenous cultures used their bones for tools. Grilled or baked Halibut is a culinary delicacy.

## Conservation

Overfishing and bycatch reduce stocks. Regulations like size limits, seasonal closures, and quotas aim to sustain populations. Aquaculture is emerging but faces challenges.

## Interesting Facts

- Halibut shift color mid-hunt, matching substrates.
- A 459-pound Halibut, caught in 1996, set a modern record.
- Their name, from “holy flatfish,” tied to medieval religious feasts.
- Larvae swim upright before flattening at 6 months.
- Halibut can dive to 3,000 feet, tolerating extreme pressure.
