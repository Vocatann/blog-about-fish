# Tuna

Tuna are powerful, warm-blooded fish dominating warm seas globally. Their speed, strength, and migratory prowess make them apex predators, vital to marine ecosystems and human economies.

## Species

Tuna encompass diverse species:

- **Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus thynnus)**: Giants up to 10 feet and 1,500 pounds, prized for sushi, critically endangered.
- **Yellowfin Tuna (Thunnus albacares)**: Named for bright yellow fins, common in tropical waters, reaching 400 pounds.
- **Albacore Tuna (Thunnus alalunga)**: Long pectoral fins, canned as “white tuna,” globally distributed.
- **Skipjack Tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis)**: Small, abundant, the backbone of canned “light tuna.”
- **Bigeye Tuna (Thunnus obesus)**: Deep-dwelling, with large eyes, valued in sashimi markets.

## Migratory Patterns

Tuna are nomadic, crossing oceans like the Atlantic or Pacific in months. Bluefin migrate from the Gulf of Mexico to the Mediterranean, guided by currents and magnetic fields. Their endothermic bodies maintain warmth, enabling dives to 500 meters.

## Habitat

They inhabit warm waters (15°C–30°C), from surface to deep ocean. Tropical and subtropical zones suit them, though Bigeye tolerate colder depths. They favor areas with strong currents and abundant prey.

## Diet

Voracious carnivores, Tuna eat mackerel, sardines, squid, and crustaceans. Their high metabolism requires constant feeding, with Bluefin consuming 5% of their body weight daily.

## Ecological Role

As apex predators, Tuna regulate populations of smaller fish, maintaining marine balance. Their migrations spread nutrients across ecosystems, supporting food webs from plankton to sharks.

## Human Interaction

Tuna drive a $40 billion industry. Bluefin fetch millions at Japanese auctions, while Skipjack dominates canned markets. Artisanal and industrial fisheries alike target Tuna, with longlining and purse seining common methods.

## Conservation

Overfishing threatens Tuna, especially Bluefin, with stocks at 3% of historic levels. International bodies like ICCAT set quotas, but enforcement lags. Marine reserves and sustainable certifications aim to curb decline.

## Interesting Facts

- Tuna reach speeds of 50 mph, their crescent-shaped tails minimizing drag.
- Their rete mirabile (vascular network) maintains body heat, unique among fish.
- Ancient Greeks depicted Tuna on coins, symbolizing wealth.
- A 2019 Bluefin sold for $3.1 million at Tokyo’s Tsukiji market.
- Tuna must swim constantly to breathe, using ram ventilation.
