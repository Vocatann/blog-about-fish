# Trout

Trout, elegant freshwater fish, grace rivers and lakes worldwide. Closely related to Salmon, they’re celebrated for their beauty, angling challenge, and ecological sensitivity.

## Species

Trout species are diverse:

- **Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)**: Vibrant stripes, widely stocked, some (Steelhead) migrate to sea.
- **Brown Trout (Salmo trutta)**: Elusive, with reddish spots, native to Europe.
- **Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis)**: Stunning vermiculations, eastern North America.
- **Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii)**: Red throat slashes, found in western U.S.
- **Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush)**: Deep-water dwellers, reaching 100 pounds.

## Habitat

Trout require cold (5°C–20°C), oxygen-rich waters—mountain streams, alpine lakes, or deep reservoirs. They’re sensitive to pollution, siltation, and temperature spikes.

## Diet

Carnivorous, Trout eat insects (mayflies, stoneflies), small fish, and crustaceans. Larger individuals target fish like minnows, becoming piscivorous. Their diet shifts seasonally with prey availability.

## Behavior

Territorial, Trout hide under rocks or logs, ambushing prey. Steelhead migrate like Salmon, returning to freshwater to spawn. Trout are crepuscular, feeding at dawn or dusk.

## Ecological Role

Trout signal ecosystem health, thriving only in pristine waters. They control insect populations and serve as prey for otters, herons, and larger fish, linking aquatic and terrestrial food webs.

## Human Interaction

Trout are a fly-fishing icon, inspiring a global angling culture. Hatcheries stock millions annually, supporting recreation and tourism. Their delicate flavor makes them a culinary favorite.

## Conservation

Habitat loss, invasive species (e.g., non-native Trout), and climate change threaten populations. Stream restoration, dam removals, and fishing regulations protect them. Native Trout reintroduction is ongoing.

## Interesting Facts

- Trout detect vibrations via otoliths, aiding prey detection.
- Some live 20+ years in stable habitats.
- Eggs hatch in 30–50 days, depending on water temperature.
- “Trout tickling,” a historic poaching technique, involves grabbing fish by hand.
- Rainbow Trout are stocked in over 80 countries.
