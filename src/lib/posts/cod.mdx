# Cod

Cod are cold-water fish pivotal to history and cuisine, thriving in the Atlantic and Pacific. Their abundance once fueled empires, but overfishing has reshaped their story.

## Historical Significance

Atlantic Cod powered economies from Viking times to the 19th century. European exploration relied on salted Cod, and the “Cod Wars” (1950s–1970s) saw Iceland and the UK clash over fishing rights. Cod shaped New England’s colonial wealth.

## Habitat

Cod inhabit depths of 50–600 feet, preferring rocky or sandy bottoms in waters below 10°C. They thrive in the Arctic, North Atlantic, and North Pacific, from Norway to Newfoundland.

## Diet

Opportunistic omnivores, Cod eat fish (haddock, herring), crustaceans, and worms. Juveniles feed on plankton, transitioning to larger prey as adults. Their chin barbel detects food on the seabed.

## Biology

Cod reach 6 feet and 200 pounds, living up to 25 years. Their streamlined bodies and mottled skin blend with ocean floors. Females release millions of eggs, though few survive predation.

## Ecological Role

Cod regulate prey populations, supporting balance in cold-water ecosystems. They’re prey for whales, seals, and sharks, linking trophic levels. Overfishing disrupts this role, cascading through food webs.

## Human Interaction

Cod’s mild, flaky meat and liver oil (rich in vitamins A and D) feed millions. Dishes like fish and chips, bacalao, and Cod cakes are global staples. Cod liver oil remains a health supplement.

## Conservation

The 1992 collapse of Atlantic Cod stocks off Newfoundland led to a fishing moratorium, with slow recovery. Pacific Cod face similar pressures. Quotas, gear restrictions, and aquaculture aim to rebuild populations.

## Interesting Facts

- Cod change color slightly to match their surroundings, aiding stealth.
- A 211-pound Cod, caught in 1895, holds the size record.
- Cod tongues and cheeks are delicacies in Newfoundland.
- Their swim bladder produces grunting sounds for communication.
- Cod were so abundant in the 1600s that sailors claimed they could walk on them.
